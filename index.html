        <p>I went on discord and told a joke, I thought it was funny and the
            server members responded with that exact same my honest reaction
            cat image. I am now forever saddened by this.</p>
        <p>To cope with this sadness I listen to this song on YouTube. You too
            can listen to it by clicking the link 
            <a href="https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0" target="_blank">here</a>
            it will open in a new tab :)

            This is a filler sentence to give the illusion that this website
            appears to be legit and professional. It serves the pupose of
            making extra content to show that I can use paragraph tag in HTML.
            By incorporating this well thought paragraph, the overall
            impression of the website is prolonged and presented with a
            heightened sense of formality, when in reality it is just saying
            the same stuff over and over and over and over and over again.

        <p>Truthfully, I don't know why reading the contents of this site still
            intrigues you... Literally just typing random stuff so the site
            seems full and meaningful, according the instructions I should be
            making another section that is exactly the same as the first
            section. It states that I should include an anchor, image and
            an external link... Sadly I can't just copy and paste the first
            section since it has to be distinct. I could probably use this 2nd
            section to create a resume line, but I am typing this instead,
            because I has smol brain.
        </p>
        <p>Anyways here is something that I made when testing out SceneBuilder
           from two years ago</p>
        <img src="./img/ethicalpic.png" width="550" height="300"
        alt="creditcard input field" title="Ethical Card Text Field">
        <p>While making that ethical SceneBuilder page I drew my inspiration
            while listening to this masterpiece on
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-541742080/candyland-earrape" 
            target="_blank"> soundcloud</a>.

        <h2 id="section-three">Section 3</h2>
        <p>
            Congrats on making it this far. Truely have so much admiration
            to how you are still reading these high quality, well-thought
            paragraphs. Putting this sentence here so section 3 seems longer.
            I currently don't know what my picture should be for this section
            so I will just take a picture of my roommate and post it here...
            with his permission ofcourse.

            Assignment #1 really taught me about basic HTML structure and CSS
            styling. It gave me insights on features that to create a responsive
            design and for it to be interactable. Doing assignment 1 gave me
            inspiration to research more about UI designs and web standards.

        <p>Must say it is a good picture. I may have done him dirty, so here
